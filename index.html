        The Thomas J. Watson Fellowship funds an original project executed during a year of independent, purposeful exploration on a world scale. I focused on exploring unrecognized nations and communities throughout the world through a cultural and social lens as it relates to identity, political landscapes and soccer. Created <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fieldsunknown/">Instagram account</a> to share additional information about teams, communities and locations I visited during my Fellowship year.

      <h3>Recognition</h3>
      <div class="p">
        My interest in computers began at the age of five, playing <a href="http://celmin.pwcsite.com/strangegames/">Stardust</a> on my dad's PowerMac 7500.  At the age of 14, I started making algorithmic art in JavaScript.  Since then, I've dabbled in lots of different languages in every paradigm, and I really enjoy learning languages.
      </div>
      <div class="p">
        I also like learning <span class="text-it">about</span> languages.  My fourth semester in college I took Intro to Linguistics and decided to minor in it.
        In order to fulfill the elective requirements, I began taking advanced Spanish classes, culminating in 300 levels.
        This combination of formal, mathematical language study, natural language study, and the study of languages caused me to reconsider what a language <span class="text-it">is</span>.
        A quote from Richard Montague interests me: <span class="text-it">“I reject the contention that an important theoretical difference exists between formal and natural languages.”</span>
      </div>
      <div class="p">
        My coursework caused me to be interested in bridging the conceptual gap between formal and natural languages.  This involves both improvements on programming languages and IDEs and also thinking about ways to improve natural language communication through technology.  Since communication is the end-all goal of language, I am also interested in accessibility and internationalization.
